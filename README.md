# NBA-Analytics-Web-App
In the world of basketball where everyone goes crazy over dunks, 3 pointers and ankle breakers,
what have always fascinated me were the statistics. Statistics opens up a door to a different world and
what this app will aim to do is to allow you to see basketball from a whole different lens like never before.

This is an NBA analytics web app where you can see up to date NBA player's statistics, 
some fun data visualization of NBA statistics, a forecast of every team's win/loss precentage for the next one year, as well the probability
of a player to win MVP and be an All-Star, with the use of machine learning models.
